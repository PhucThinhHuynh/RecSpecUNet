# RecSpecUNet: A Recycled and Selective Architecture for Efficient Spectrogram Segmentation

This paper presents RecSpecUNet, a deep learning model based on UNet, designed for automatic detection of Fifth Generation (5G), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and radar signals in timeâ€“frequency spectrograms for next-generation wireless networks. The proposed architecture integrates two key innovations to enhance both identification accuracy and real-time efficiency: (i) the recycled convolution module, which reduces redundant deep-stage features and improves model compactness, and (ii) the selective channel concatenation module, which strengthens long-range dependencies and enhances channel interaction and spatial representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RecSpecUNet achieves outstanding performance, attaining 98.7% mean accuracy and 95.8% mean Intersection-over-Union with only 2.6M parameters and a low 1.9ms inference time. Compared to the baseline UNet, RecSpecUNet reduces parameters by 81.8% and GFLOPs by 25.5%, establishing it as a highly efficient and practical solution for real-time spectrum sensing on resource-constrained mobile devices.
